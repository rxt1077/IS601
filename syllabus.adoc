= IS601: Python for Web API Development

== Description

This course is meant as an introduction to the Python programming language through the lens of transferring data on the web.
Students will learn the general structures and syntax of Python programs and be able to generate their own programs to move data via HTTP.
Students will work with common web interchange formats to both make requests and provide responses.
By the conclusion of the course, students will have built a backend web program that supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting objects stored on a database.

== Prerequisites

While this is an introductory course, students are still expected to have some computing background.
Students should be familiar with file system structure, running programs from the command line, installing programs, editing text files, and basic networking concepts.

== Resources

* To better match industry trends and standards, this class will utilize online resources in lieu of a traditional textbook. Resources will be provided as the course progresses, but some primary resources are listed here:
** https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp[w3schools - Python Tutorial]
** https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/[Python - The Python Tutorial]
** https://https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp[w3schools - SQL Tutorial]
** https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/learn/[FastAPI - Introductory Sections and Tutorials] 
* This class utilizes the https://canvas.njit.edu[Canvas learning management system]. You can find assignments, assessments, and learning resources there.
* This class will utilize the Respondus proctoring system for the midterm and final.
* This class also has a https://github.com/rxt1077/is601[GitHub page] where you can find out how the course materials are built and have changed over time.
* Students are required to have a device that meets the https://ist.njit.edu/student-computers-recommended-specs[YWCC minimum specifications]. They will need administrative access to this device to install software. The device should be functional (charged, working) and brought to class.

== Grading

Assignments and assessments are graded via SpeedGrader with comments left using the same system. 
Feedback on assignments, midterms, finals, and project deliverables will be delivered within two weeks of their due date.

The course grade is weighted based on five assignment categories:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|20%|Exercises
|20%|Midterm
|20%|Midterm Project
|20%|Final
|20%|Final Project
|===

== Exams

All exams and quizzes will use Respondus, so be sure to bring a compatible device with you on the day of the assessment.
The midterm will take place during a regular class period and will cover the material from weeks one to six.
The final exam will be during finals week.
The final is not strictly cumulative and largely covers the material from the midterm until the end of the course.
That being said, a complete understanding of the second half topics will require using some knowledge from the beginning of the course.
Exams and quizzes will be closed book and must be taken in the classroom if the class is meeting face-to-face.

== Project

This course will include a midterm and final project to be completed individually.
The goal of the project is to give students a more long-term development experience than is possible with the weekly exercises.
In order to maintain academic integrity, students will be asked to use a version control system so they can demonstrate through their commit log that they completed the project individually over the course of several weeks.

== Course Schedule

Each class, students will receive a class lecture and perform an exercise
Students are expected to use the lessons learned in class to continue their project work between each class session.

== Policies

=== Academic Integrity

Academic Integrity is the cornerstone of higher education and is central to the ideals of this course and the university.
Cheating is strictly prohibited and devalues the degree that you are working on.
As a member of the NJIT community, it is your responsibility to protect your educational investment by knowing and following the http://www5.njit.edu/policies/sites/policies/files/academic-integrity-code.pdf[academic code of integrity policy.]

Please note that it is my professional obligation and responsibility to report any academic misconduct to the Dean of Students Office.
Any student found in violation of the code by cheating, plagiarizing or using any online software inappropriately will result in disciplinary action.
This may include a failing grade of F, and/or suspension or dismissal from the university.
If you have any questions about the code of Academic Integrity, please contact the Dean of Students Office at dos@njit.edu.

=== Requesting Accommodations

If you are in need of accommodations due to a disability please contact the https://www.njit.edu/studentsuccess/accessibility[Office of Accessibility Resources & Services (OARS)], Fenster Hall Room 260 to discuss your specific needs.
A Letter of Accommodation Eligibility from the OARS authorizing your accommodations will be required.

=== Resources for NJIT Students

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xGO2qcVEF1tsOgZn-_W1LjSOKn_jhEVs9IWI_6jeuPs/edit?usp=sharing[NJIT Service for Students], including Technical Support.

=== Class Etiquette

Students who are the most successful attend and participate in class.
If you have questions, please ask them. This makes the class more dynamic and interesting for everyone.

=== Proctoring

NJIT policy requires that all midterm and final exams must be proctored, regardless of delivery mode, in order to increase academic integrity.
Note that this does not apply to essay or authentic based assessments.
Effective beginning Fall semester 2019, students registered for a fully online course section (e.g., online or Hyflex mode) must be given the option to take their exam in a completely online format, with appropriate proctoring.

Exams will be given in-person using https://njit.instructure.com/courses/21706/pages/respondus-lockdown-browser-and-monitor[Respondus].
Be sure to bring your charged laptop and charger on the day of exams.

=== Late Work/Makeups

Late work can be turned in before the end of the semester for half credit.

For our final project we will be creating a REST API backend for our dosa restaurant.
Your project will need to use an https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html[SQLite] database and https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/[FastAPI] to provide access to three objects: _customers_, _items_, and _orders_.
https://github.com/rxt1077/IS601/blob/master/midterm_project/example_orders.json[_example_orders.json_ file from the midterm project].

You will be making an API that supports CRUD (create, read, update, delete) for your three objects.
Your must write a script named _init_db.py_ that will initialize an empty database using relational constraints (primary keys and foreign keys) from the https://github.com/rxt1077/IS601/blob/master/midterm_project/example_orders.json[_example_orders.json_ file] we used in the midterm project.
Your SQLite database should be in a file named _db.sqlite_.
Your FastAPI backend must read and write from _db.sqlite_ and should be called _main.py_.

You will need to create the following endpoints:

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Method|Path|Description

|POST
|/customers
|creates a customer in the DB given a JSON representation

|GET
|/customers/{id}
|retrieves a JSON representation of a customer in the DB

|DELETE
|/customers/{id}
|deletes a customer in the DB

|PUT
|/customers/{id}
|updates a customer in the DB given a JSON representation

|POST

|POST
|/orders
|creates an order in the DB given a JSON representation

|GET
|/orders/{id}

|DELETE

= Static Files

== Static vs. Dynamic

[.shrink]
* We have been focusing on rendering templates for our views this is _dynamic_
  in that the view can be different depending on what is in the database.
* Some of our content will be static: images, CSS, JavaScript, etc.
* Static files are not _rendered_ and do not change for the view.
* Static files are requested via a GET request and are served from a directory.
* Websites _used_ to be simply made up of static files, and many still are:
  https://pages.github.com/[GitHub Pages]
* Web Apps tend to be dynamic (an interesting exception being client-side JS
  frameworks)

== Changes to the project-wide settings.py file

* Make sure `django.contrib.staticfiles` is included in `INSTALLED_APPS`
* Make sure `STATIC_URL` is set to the URL you want to use. We will be using
  `/static/`: `STATIC_URL = '/static/'`

== Changes to your templates

[source, jinja]
----
{% load static %}
<img src="{% static 'example/brownies.jpg' %} alt="brownies"> <1>
----
<1> This will serve `brownies.jpg` from `example/static/example/brownies.jpg`.
    Yes, it seems awfully nested, but this will allow us to use images with the
    same names in multiple applications and not get mixed up. 

== Production Issues

[.shrink]
We will not be deploying in this class, so the development server should meet
all our needs. That being said, using a dynamic framework to serve static files
is very inefficient:

[plantuml, static-dynamic, svg]
....
@startuml
actor Client as client
participant "Web Server" as webserver
participant "Django" as django
database "Database" as db

client -> webserver: GET /static/brownies.jpg
webserver -> django : WSGI (GET /static/brownies.jpg)
django -> db : SQL (get site options/etc.)
db --> django : site options
django --> webserver : brownies.jpg from app directory
webserver --> client : brownies.jpg
@enduml
....

=== Production Issues (continued)

[.shrink]
A web server _is designed to_ serve static content and can do it on its own:

[plantuml, static, svg]
....
@startuml
actor Client as client
participant "Web Server" as webserver

client -> webserver: GET /static/brownies.jpg
webserver --> client : /var/www/static/brownies.jpg
@enduml
....

=== Options

* Run a separate web server for the static files.
* Tell the web server that is serving your Django content to also serve static
  files from a directory.
* Use a separate service: S3 bucket, Azure BLOB, etc.
* However you choose to do it, `manage.py collectstatic` will copy all of your
  static files to `STATIC_ROOT`, making deployment easier.

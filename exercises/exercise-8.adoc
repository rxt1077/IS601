= Exercise 8

This exercise is designed make you read documentation and create a program that solves a problem.
While this is less explicit than some of the other exercises, it more closely mimics the process of someone utilizing a web API in the real world.

Create a Python script named `joke.py` that utilizes the https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[Requests Python package] and the https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api[icanhazdadjoke.com API] to print out a joke in plain text when it is run.

For this exercise all you need to submit for this is your `joke.py` file.
I'll have the requests package installed already.

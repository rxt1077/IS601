== Classes

[.column]
[source,python]
----
class Pokemon():
    def __init__(self, name, ptype, health):
        self.name = name
        self.ptype = ptype
        self.health = health

    def attack(self):
        # do attack stuff

    def dodge(self):
        # do dodge stuff

    def evolve(self):
        # do evolve stuff
----

[.column.shrink]
* classes are defined with the `class` keyword
* they have a reference to their object: `self`
* they store attributes (name, type, health) _and_ methods (attack, dodge, evolve)
* `\\__init__()` is called when an object is made
* https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#class-names[class names should be CapWords]

== Creating Objects

[source,python]
----
pikachu = Pokemon("Pikachu", "Electric", 70)
print(pikachu.name)
----

* you create an instance of a class by passing `\\__init__()` arguments to it
* now you have an object that represents a single Pokemon
* this way you can reuse code and still have many different Pokemon
* instances should be snake_case

== OOP Concepts

rectangle object [
Object
--
code blocks that
make up the app

Class

an object with 
attributes and
methods

    rectangle inherit [
        Inheritance

        the basis for other
        classes

=== Abstraction

* To use our `Pokemon` class, you don't need to know much about how it works
* We could put it in a Python package, distribute it, and with a little documentation others could start using it
* This allows more complex apps to be built without having to worry about the details
* It's a _huge_ selling point for the Python ecosystem 

=== Inheritance

[source,python]
----
class LegendaryPokemon(Pokemon):
    def __init__(self, name, ptype, health, legendary_group):
        super().__init__(name, ptype, health)
        self.legendary_group = legendary_group

    def legendary_attack(self):
        # do legendary attack stuff
----

* you can build classes based off other classes
* this allows you to add new methods or attributes and _inherit_ the existing methods and attributes 
* it allows for more DRY (don't repeat yourself) code
* `super()` accesses the parent class

=== Encapsulation

* Our `Pokemon` class keeps all the data we need about a Pokemon in one place
* It provides access to methods for working with that data
* This makes it easy to "wrap up" a concept and keep control over how it changes in the application

=== Polymorphism

* By designing our classes with similar methods and attributes we can make them "look" the same
* Perhaps every character has a health attribute, trainers _and_ Pokemon
* This makes it easier to work with the classes we create
* It makes code more consistent and predictable
* Inheritance can definitely help achieve this

== Try it Out

[IMPORTANT]
====
. Open VSCode and create a Python file named _trainer.py_.
. In that file, create a class called Trainer that has a `name` attribute and a `health` attribute.
. Add a `print_info()` method to your class that prints _My name is <name> and I have <health> health_ (where <name> and <health> are the trainer's name and health).
. In an interactive Python shell import that file and create a instance of `Trainer` with the name _Ash_ and _100_ health.
. While you have the shell open, test to see that `print_info()` works.

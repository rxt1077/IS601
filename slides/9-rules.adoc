= The Nine Indispensable Rules for Debugging

== Credits

* Based on the David J. Agans Book, _The 9 Indispensable Rules for Finding Even the Most Elusive Software and Hardware Problems_
* A _very_ short book, I highly suggest you check it out
* Warrants a re-read every few years

== When do we start debugging?

== Debugging vs. Troubleshooting

* Troubleshooting is often what I do with your code:
** How does it differ from the example?
** What have you changed?
* Debugging is deeper:
** What's wrong with the design?
** Do I need to change the way I think about the problem?
** Can I avoid this in the future?

== The Rules

[.column]
. Understand the system
. Make it fail
. Quit thinking and look
. Divide and conquer
. Change one thing at a time

[.column,start=6]
. Keep an audit trail
. Check the plug
. Get a fresh view
. If you didn't fix it, it ain't fixed

== Understand the System

* Read the manual
* Now read it again
* Know what's reasonable
* Nothing is "magic"
* Know your tools
* Look it up

== Make it Fail

* Can you replicate the bug?
* Stimulate don't _simulate_ the failure
* Intermittent failures are the worst!
** Why is it intermittent?
** Is it fixed?

== Quit Thinking and Look

* See the failure, make sure it _is_ the failure
* Worry about the details
* Build alerts in and turn them on!
* Use version control and get your hands dirty.

== Divide and Conquer

* Binary search
* Isolate a range
* Bugs within the range you're working on
* Start with the easy stuff

== Change One Thing at a Time

* Isolate the key factor
* What have you changed recently?
* One test at a time

== Keep an Audit Trail

* What did you do, what happened? These are rarely git commits but they're typically notes.
* Gather and write down information. What _exactly_ happened? For how long? When?
* Use git!
* Add info to your commit message when you fix it

== Check the Plug

* Question your assumptions
** Is the file you're editing the one you're running?
** Have you saved the file you're editing?
* Start at the beginning
** Does this code need some initialization?
* Test the tool
** Is it running?
** Are you using the right interpreter?

== Get a Fresh View

* Rubber Duck it
* Check in with other people
** Report symptoms not theories
* Take a walk

== If You Didn't Fix it, It Ain't Fixed

* Check that it's really fixed
* Check that it's really your fix that fixed it
* Know that it _never_ just goes away by itself
* Fix the cause
* Fix the process
